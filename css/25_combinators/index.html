    <h2>CSS Combinators</h2>
    <h3>There are four different combinators in CSS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
        <li>child selector (>)</li>
        <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
        <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    <h2>Descendant Selector</h2>
    <p>The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>
    <p>The following example selects all < p > elements inside < div > elements:</p>
    <div>
        <p>Paragraph 1 is in div</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2 is in div</p>
        <section><p>Paragraph 3 is in div</p></section>
    </div>
    <p>Paragraph 4 is not in div.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 5 is not in div.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Child Selector (>)</h2>
    <p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</p>
    <p>The following example selects all < p > elements that are children of a < div > element:</p>
    <div class="div_1">
        <p>Paragraph 1 is in div 1</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2 is in div 1</p>
        <section><p>Paragraph 3 is in div 1 (but also is in section element)</p></section>
    </div>
    <p>Paragraph 4 is not in div 1.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 5 is not in div 1.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h2>
    <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
    <p>Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following"</p>
    <p>The following example selects the first < p > element that are placed immediately after < div > elements:</p>
    <div class="div_2">
        <p>Paragraph is in div 2.</p>
        <p>Paragraph is in div 2.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 2. After a div</p>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 2. After a div</p>

    <div class="div_2">
        <p>Paragraph is in div 2.</p>
        <p>Paragraph is in div 2.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 2. After a div</p>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 2. After a div</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>General Sibling Selector (~)</h2>
    <p>The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.</p>
    <p>The following example selects all < p > elements that are next siblings of < div > elements:</p>
    <div class="div_3">
        <p>Paragraph is in div 3.</p>
        <p>Paragraph is in div 3.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 3.</p>
    <code>Some code here</code>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 3.</p>
    <code>Some code here</code>
    <p>Paragraph is not in div 3.</p>
